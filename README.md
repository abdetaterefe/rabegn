# Rabegn ራበኝ

rabegn is a flutter recipe app mainly focused on Ethiopian food 

## Appendix

this app fully made with getx state managenment, getx pattern structure and firebase for backend solution

the app have role based auth, the admin can add and delete recipes and can only delete and see users

I made this app as hobby project, the idea making this app came from wanting to know to cook food as i was about leave my family for learnig in another city because i have to know how to cook by myself when i live alone

i'm working on the app, its not complete project as its hobby project i might not completly finish or provide update even if i finish the app

እንጃ ብቻ አፑ ስጀምረው ርቦኝ ነበር መሰለኝ ስሙን ራበኝ ያልኩት

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/abdetaterefe/rabegn.git
